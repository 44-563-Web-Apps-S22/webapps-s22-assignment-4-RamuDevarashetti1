        <h4>ACT II : Leaving CLITANDRE and still speaking to him</h4>

        <p>SCENE I; CHRYSALE, ARISTE.</p>
        <h6>ARI</h6> <p>Good day to you, brother.</p>
        <h6>CHRY</h6> <p>And to you also, brother.</p>
        <h6>ARI</h6> <p>Do you know what brings me here?</p>
        <h6>CHRY</h6> <p>No, I do not; but I am ready to hear it, if it pleases you to
            tell me.</p>
        <h6>ARI</h6> <p>You have known Clitandre for some time now?</p>
        <h6>CHRY</h6> <p>Certainly; and he often comes to our house.</p>
        <h6>ARI</h6> <p>And what do you think of him?</p>
        <h6>CHRY</h6> <p>I think him to be a man of honour, wit, courage, and
            uprightness, and I know very few people who have more merit.</p>
        <h6>ARI</h6> <p>A certain wish of his has brought me here; and I am glad to see
            the esteem you have for him.</p>
        <h6>CHRY</h6><p> I became acquainted with his late father when I was in Rome.</p>
        <h6>ARI</h6><p> Ah!</p>
        <h6>CHRY</h6><p> He was a perfect gentleman.</p>
        
        <p>SCENE II.--BÃ‰LISE (_entering softly and listening_), CHRYSALE,
            ARISTE.</p>
        <h6>ARI</h6> <p>Clitandre has chosen me to be his interpreter to you; he has
            fallen in love with Henriette.</p>
        <h6>CHRY</h6> <p>What! with my daughter?</p>
        <h6>ARI</h6> <p>How so, sister?</p>
        <h6>BEL</h6> <p>Clitandre deceives you; it is with another that he is in love.</p>
        <h6>ARI</h6> <p>It is not with Henriette that he is in love? You are joking.</p>
        <h6>BEL</h6> <p>No; I am telling the perfect truth.</p>
        <h6>ARI</h6> <p>He told me so himself.</p>
