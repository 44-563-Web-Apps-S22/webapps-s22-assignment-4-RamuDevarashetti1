        <h4>ACT II : Leaving CLITANDRE and still speaking to him</h4>
        <p class="direction"> SCENE I; CHRYSALE, ARISTE.</p>
        <h6 class="ariste name">ARI.</h6> <p class="speech">Good day to you, brother.</p>
        <h6 class="chrysale name">CHRY.</h6> <p class="speech">And to you also, brother.</p>
        <h6 class="ariste name">ARI.</h6> <p class="speech">Do you know what brings me here?</p>
        <h6 class="chrysale name">CHRY.</h6> <p class="speech">No, I do not; but I am ready to hear it, if it pleases you to
            tell me.</p>
        <h6 class="ariste name">ARI.</h6> <p class="speech">You have known Clitandre for some time now?</p>
        <h6 class="chrysale name">CHRY.</h6> <p class="speech">Certainly; and he often comes to our house.</p>
        <h6 class="ariste name">ARI.</h6> <p class="speech">And what do you think of him?</p>
        <h6 class="chrysale name">CHRY.</h6> <p class="speech">I think him to be a man of honour, wit, courage, and
            uprightness, and I know very few people who have more merit.</p>
        <h6 class="ariste name">ARI.</h6> <p class="speech">A certain wish of his has brought me here; and I am glad to see
            the esteem you have for him.</p>
        <h6 class="chrysale name">CHRY.</h6><p class="speech"> I became acquainted with his late father when I was in Rome.</p>
        <h6 class="ariste name">ARI.</h6><p class="speech"> Ah!</p>
        <h6 class="chrysale name">CHRY.</h6><p class="speech"> He was a perfect gentleman.</p>

        <p class="direction">SCENE II.--BÃ‰LISE (_entering softly and listening_), CHRYSALE,
            ARISTE.</p>
        <h6 class="ariste name">ARI.</h6> <p class="speech">Clitandre has chosen me to be his interpreter to you; he has
            fallen in love with Henriette.</p>
        <h6 class="chrysale name">CHRY.</h6> <p class="speech">What! with my daughter?</p>
        <h6 class="ariste name">ARI.</h6> <p class="speech">How so, sister?</p>
        <h6 class="belise name">BEL.</h6> <p class="speech">Clitandre deceives you; it is with another that he is in love.</p>
        <h6 class="ariste name">ARI.</h6> <p class="speech">It is not with Henriette that he is in love? You are joking.</p>
        <h6 class="belise name">BEL.</h6> <p class="speech">No; I am telling the perfect truth.</p>
        <h6 class="ariste name">ARI.</h6> <p class="speech">He told me so himself.</p>
