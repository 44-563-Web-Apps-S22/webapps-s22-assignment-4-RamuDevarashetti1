        <h4>ACT II : Leaving CLITANDRE and still speaking to him</h4>
        <p>
            CHRYSALE, ARISTE.<br>
            ARI. Good day to you, brother.<br>
            CHRY. And to you also, brother.<br>
            ARI. Do you know what brings me here?<br>
            CHRY. No, I do not; but I am ready to hear it, if it pleases you to
            tell me.<br>
            ARI. You have known Clitandre for some time now?<br>
            CHRY. Certainly; and he often comes to our house.<br>
            ARI. And what do you think of him?<br>
            CHRY. I think him to be a man of honour, wit, courage, and
            uprightness, and I know very few people who have more merit.<br>
            ARI. A certain wish of his has brought me here; and I am glad to see
            the esteem you have for him.<br>
            CHRY. I became acquainted with his late father when I was in Rome.<br>
            ARI. Ah!<br>
            CHRY. He was a perfect gentleman.<br>
            ARI. So it is said.<br>
            CHRY. We were only about twenty-eight years of age, and, upon my word,
            we were, both of us, very gay young fellows.<br>
            ARI. I believe it.<br>
            CHRY. We greatly affected the Roman ladies, and everybody there spoke
            of our pranks. We made many people jealous, I can tell you.<br>
            ARI. Excellent; but let us come to what brings me here.<br>
